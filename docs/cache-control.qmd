When using any static website host it's important to to ensure you have control over when
files are cached on an edge and for how long. Here are some basics.

By default, all sites use a default setting of `no-store`. This ensures that it won't
ever even be stored in a cache and will always end up back at the origin for each request.

If you have a `min-age` of greater than 0 in your distribution settings. 
CloudFront will ignore any directives telling it not to cache items.
