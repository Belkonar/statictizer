## Storage Type

There are currently two storage types.

* MongoDB
* S3

MongoDB allows for faster feedback due to the really efficient batching in the upload. It does however
have a limit of 16k for document size. S3 is batched via semaphore but it's no where near as efficient.
S3 however is cheaper if you use Atlas.

As a result, if you are using the site for a project (like I do with Archi and Quarto): Use MongoDB.
If you are are using it for a product where it's primarily managed via pipeline: use S3.

If you do happen to use S3, the keys are in the form of `{host}/{key}` so you can choose to sync them
another way and still use statictizer to serve them up.
